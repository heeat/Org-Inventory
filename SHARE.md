# Sharing Your Plugin with Friends

Here's how to share your Salesforce Org Inventory plugin with friends using your existing GitHub repository:

## Step 1: Push your code to your existing repository

```bash
# Add your existing GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/heeat/Org-Inventory.git

# Push your code to the repository
git push -u origin main
```

If your main branch is called "master" instead of "main", use:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 2: Share the installation instructions

Send your friends the INSTALL.md file or direct them to your repository, where they can follow the installation steps.

The plugin is now ready for your friends to install and use!
